## About

![alt text](public/app.png)

[Drum Machine](https://csb-wfx43.netlify.app/) was done for Front End Development Libraries Certification at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). At it's core it uses React and Semantic UI for simple visuals and mobile responsiveness. It accepts button clicks or key press in order to make your tune!


> Also check out [Nicholas Meisenheimer](https://github.com/souredoutlook)'s awesome [CREATION](https://youtu.be/cwlLqKxfED4) that will probably make it straight to the top charts.
